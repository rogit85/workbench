# Underwriting Workbench (Red/White/Grey) â€” v8
- **risk.html** now uses a **wider canvas** (max-width 1680px) with a **440px right rail**. Main content grids widened (2.8 : 1.2 split), larger map/loss widgets.
- Assignment dock sits in the **far-right column** (sticky, no overlap), directly under the top bar.
- All other pages unchanged from v7; price chart remains in Company Financials.
